# Main Page

<hr>
This is a ruff draft of the main page for the website. I have set the name of the salon bussiness in the top left corner with the two main categories underneath it. In the main area of the page it would show the products subcategories along with a search bar just above the subcategories on the right side. In the top right corner there is a checkout button and a LogIn button. The customer would be able to shop and checkout as a guest or become a registered customer of the salon to receive discounts on products.
