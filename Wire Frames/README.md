# Salon Wire Frames

The following links are of each of the possible web pages that I would like to get to with this design. Each page has a description of what would be on that page with the possiblity to add more features as they arise.

[Main Page](MainPage.md)
<hr>

[Log In Page](LogInPage.md)
<hr>

[Main Page after Log In](MainPageAfterLogIn.md)
<hr>

[Searching without logging In](SearchingWithoutLoggingIn.md)
<hr>

[Searching After logging In](SearchingAfterLoggedIn.md)
<hr>

[Individual Product Page](IndividualProductPage.md)
<hr>

[Initial Checkout Page](InitialCheckoutPage.md)
<hr>

[Shipping Address Page](ShippingAddressPage.md)
<hr>

[Billing Address Page](BillingAddressPage.md)
<hr>

The shipping method and payment method haven't been set into place in order to keep finacial information secure and using outside companies to ship and linking with finacial institutions. These are stages that I'm working towards in a later stage of building.
